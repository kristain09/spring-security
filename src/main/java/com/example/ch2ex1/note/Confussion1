don't use mixed configuration style!

if we use bean than use bean, if we override methods, so use methods!

Example:
passwordEncoder using beans and configurer use override implementation. so it will trigger a confusion.


Don't use chained too much, it is better separate and write responsibilities as decoupled possible in an applciation.
It is better use decoupled rather than .and()

Because of spring security is flexible, the use of this framework needs responsibility.
It is possible to change the design it self.
